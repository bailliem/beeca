#### Truth 4: Go/No-Go Recommendation Explicit and Justified

**Recommendation Statement (Line 13):**
> **Recommendation:** **CONDITIONAL GO** - Proceed with **Phase 1 (minimal)** implementation that accepts GEE objects for single-timepoint covariate-adjusted analysis.

**Rationale Section (Lines 481-492):**
1. Empirical evidence is strong
2. Immediate value (clustered data use case)
3. Minimal scope expansion
4. Low maintenance burden
5. Preserves package identity
6. Aligns with beeca philosophy

**Three Options Analyzed:**
- Option A (Minimal): 3.5 days - RECOMMENDED (line 340: "Recommendation: YES")
- Option B (Multi-timepoint): 3 weeks - NOT RECOMMENDED (line 408: "Recommendation: NO")
- Option C (Companion package): 6-7 weeks - DEFERRED (line 466: "defer decision")

**Status:** ✓ VERIFIED - Clear, justified, actionable recommendation

#### Truth 5: Implementation Plan Scoped with Time Estimates

**Section 8 "Next Steps - If GO - Option A" (Lines 583-614):**

| Phase | Tasks | Time Estimate |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 1.1.1: Implement GEE S3 Methods | 3 tasks | 1 day |
| 1.1.2: Route Ge Variance to GEE vcov | 3 tasks | 1 day |
| 1.1.3: Disable Ye Method for GEE | 3 tasks | 0.5 day |
| 1.1.4: Testing and Documentation | 4 tasks | 1 day |
| **TOTAL** | **13 tasks** | **3.5 days** |

**Deliverables Defined (Lines 608-613):**
- GEE objects accepted for single-timepoint analysis
- Mancl-DeRouen correction available
- Clear error for Ye method
- Documentation with examples
- Test coverage 95%+

**Status:** ✓ VERIFIED - Detailed, task-level breakdown with realistic estimates

## Summary

**Strengths:**
1. Rigorous empirical validation: Both glmtoolbox and geepack tested

5. Proper wiring: Test results flow into report, report informs decision

**Quality Indicators:**
- Zero stub patterns detected
- All artifacts substantive (minimum 170 lines, maximum 690 lines)
- Structured summaries with dependency tracking (frontmatter: requires/provides/affects)
- Evidence-based decision making (empirical tests → analysis → recommendation)

**Deliverable Quality:**
