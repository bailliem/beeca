<objective>
Update README.md to accurately reflect beeca v0.3.0 features, examples, and installation instructions for the GitHub release.

Purpose: DOCS-01 requirement — README must reflect current v0.3.0 features and serve as the single source of truth for the pkgdown homepage.
Output: Updated README.md ready for v0.3.0 GitHub release.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update README.md for v0.3.0</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Perform a moderate rewrite of README.md following these locked decisions from CONTEXT.md:

    1. **Badges**: Review and update the badges block:
       - Keep lifecycle:stable badge (correct)
       - Keep CRAN status badge (will show 0.2.0 — that's fine, it's what's on CRAN)
       - Keep R-CMD-check badge (verify workflow URL is correct)
       - Keep test-coverage badge (verify workflow URL is correct)
       - All badges should render and link correctly

    2. **Overview paragraph**: Update the opening paragraph to:
       - Mention v0.3.0 explicitly if appropriate (or let version be implicit via CRAN/GitHub)
       - Keep focus on marginal estimands, binary endpoints, covariate adjustment
       - Keep reference to Magirr et al. (2025)
       - Keep GxP environments focus
       - Do NOT mention GEE or future work

    3. **Installation section**: Restructure to lead with GitHub install:
       - Lead with `remotes::install_github("openpharma/beeca")` as the primary install method
       - Keep CRAN as secondary option (`install.packages("beeca")`)
       - Keep the table format but reorder rows (Development first, Release second)

    4. **Methodology section**: Review and update:
       - Fix the double-quote typo: `Products Guidance for Industry""` should be single `"`
       - Verify all DOI links are correct and resolving
       - Keep existing content — it's accurate

    5. **Scope section**: Review and keep as-is (accurate for v0.3.0)

    6. **Examples section**: The existing examples already show beeca_fit() (Quick Start) and manual workflow. Review for accuracy:
       - Verify beeca_fit() example matches current function signature
       - Verify manual workflow example is correct
       - Add brief mention of new v0.3.0 features if not already present (S3 methods like tidy(), summary table, forest plot)
       - Lead with beeca_fit() (simpler approach for clinical statisticians) — this is already the case

    7. **Package documentation section**: Keep link to pkgdown site. Consider adding links to key vignettes (ARD, clinical trial reporting) if not already present.

    8. **Quality checks section**: Keep as-is (accurate cross-validation info)

    9. **Package authors section**: Verify matches DESCRIPTION Authors@R

    10. **Acknowledgments section**: Keep as-is (working group credit)

    11. **References section**: Verify all references match DESCRIPTION and are complete with DOIs. Current state looks good — verify no missing references.

    Keep the existing section structure — no new sections needed (per CONTEXT.md).
    Only include shipping v0.3.0 features — no GEE feasibility or future work.
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Visually inspect README.md for v0.3.0 accuracy
    2. Check all URLs/DOIs in README by verifying format (no broken markdown links)
    3. Cross-check authors against DESCRIPTION
    4. Verify no mention of GEE or future features
    5. Verify GitHub install listed before CRAN
  </verify>
  <done>
    README.md accurately reflects v0.3.0 features. GitHub install is primary. All badges render correctly. Examples show beeca_fit() and manual workflow. No GEE or future work mentioned. Ready to serve as pkgdown homepage.
  </done>
