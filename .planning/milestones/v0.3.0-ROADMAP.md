# Milestone v0.3.0: GitHub Release Readiness

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-07
**Phases:** 1-4 (plus 1.1 inserted)
**Total Plans:** 11

## Overview

This roadmap guided the v0.3.0 GitHub release readiness review for the beeca R package. The journey validated build integrity, reviewed documentation accuracy, ensured vignette quality (especially ARD and clinical trial reporting examples), and prepared release artifacts. Core value: All R CMD checks pass with no errors or warnings.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Build Validation

**Goal**: All package checks and tests pass without errors or warnings
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Run R CMD check and testthat suite, capture results
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Triage issues with user, apply fixes, finalize validation

**Details:**
- R CMD check: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 3 acceptable notes
- 302 testthat tests passing, 88.90% code coverage
- Fixed critical vignette build error (fit_study1 undefined)
- Accepted beeca_to_cards_ard() 0% coverage (demonstrated in vignette)

### Phase 1.1: GEE Longitudinal Extension Feasibility (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Determine feasibility and scope of extending beeca to support GEE-fitted models for longitudinal binary endpoints
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01.1-01-PLAN.md — Run GEE feasibility test script through beeca pipeline
- [x] 01.1-02-PLAN.md — Synthesize results into feasibility report with go/no-go recommendation

**Details:**
- Empirically confirmed predict(newdata) and vcov(type='robust') work with GEE objects
- Tested both glmtoolbox (glmgee) and geepack (geeglm) packages
- CONDITIONAL GO recommendation for Option A (minimal, single-timepoint)
- Scoped implementation: 3.5 days, 4 phases for future version
- Research-only phase — no code changes to package

### Phase 2: Documentation Review

**Goal**: All documentation is accurate and complete for v0.3.0
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Review and standardize all man page documentation + DESCRIPTION audit
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Update README.md for v0.3.0
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Restructure pkgdown site and verify build

**Details:**
- Standardized all roxygen2 documentation across 25+ man pages
- Created complete @seealso cross-reference chains
- Fixed beeca_fit() reference argument bug (subscript out of bounds)
- Updated README for v0.3.0 (GitHub install primary, features documented)
- Restructured pkgdown with 7 task-based reference sections

### Phase 3: Vignette Review

**Goal**: All vignettes are clear, informative, and render without errors
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Polish estimand vignette: add hook, method guidance, update references
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Polish ARD and clinical-trial-table vignettes, verify all vignettes render

**Details:**
- Added problem-based opening hooks with motivation scenarios
- Created "Which method should I use?" guidance (Ye vs Ge)
- ARD vignette opens with CSR Table 14.2.1 scenario using trial02_cdisc
- Complete cross-vignette navigation chain established
- All 3 vignettes build and pass R CMD check

### Phase 4: Release Preparation

**Goal**: Package is ready for v0.3.0 GitHub release
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Restructure NEWS.md to tidyverse style and update OSF references to published DOI
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Create release branch, run validation suite, verify release readiness

**Details:**
- NEWS.md restructured: 11 new features, 4 improvements, 1 bug fix
- Updated all Magirr et al. references from OSF preprint to published DOI (10.1002/pst.70021)
- Created release/v0.3.0 branch and pushed to origin
- Fixed ggplot2 deprecation (geom_errorbarh → geom_errorbar)
- Fixed pre-existing test failure (perfect separation handling)
- Final: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 308 tests pass

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 1.1: GEE Longitudinal Extension Feasibility (inserted after Phase 1 for user feature request)

**Key Decisions:**

- GitHub release (not CRAN): Faster iteration, less overhead
- Version 0.3.0 (minor bump): New features since 0.2.0 warrant minor version
- trial02_cdisc as primary dataset: CDISC ADaM format, 3-arm design, industry standard
- trial01 retained for cross-validation: Pre-computed SAS results available
- Magirr et al. updated to published DOI: Published in Pharmaceutical Statistics 2025
- beeca_to_cards_ard() 0% coverage accepted: Working in vignette, minimal value for timeline
- GEE extension conditional go (deferred): Out of scope for v0.3.0, future version
- ggplot2 deprecation fixed for release: Clean release, no user-visible warnings

**Issues Resolved:**

- Critical vignette build error (fit_study1 undefined in ard-cards-integration.Rmd)
- beeca_fit() reference argument bug (subscript out of bounds)
- ggplot2 4.0.0 deprecation (geom_errorbarh → geom_errorbar)
- Pre-existing test failure (perfect separation test expectation)

**Issues Deferred:**

- GEE/longitudinal extension (CONDITIONAL GO for future version, Option A scoped)
- beeca_to_cards_ard() unit tests (0% coverage, demonstrated in vignette)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- beeca_to_cards_ard() has 0% test coverage (working in vignette, tests deferred)
